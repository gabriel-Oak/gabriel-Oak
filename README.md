Hello World, I have been working with systems development since 2019 and I am passionate about what I do. I started programming at the age of 13, so I can safely say that coding occupies most of my life.

I always seek to deliver with quality, automated tests and clean architecture, even if I don't use the clean arch itself. I'm communicative and I try to clear up doubts before starting to develop a feature, I need to be sure of what the end user expects to receive, or discover together with him.

I recently worked leading projects and my team, delegating tasks and supporting other devs as needed. Whenever I can, I try to share knowledge and train my teammates, in order to achieve an even greater collective result.

I like to know that what I do changes people's lives, well-used technology has the power to revolutionize the market, societies and change lives just as it changed mine.

When I'm not with my face at a computer you can find me hiking in the woods, camping or climbing rocks for fun.
